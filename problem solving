2.How can we read exampl.ipynb file in my ipython notebook.
First, make sure you already installed ipython notebook. 
Second, in VM you need to clone the questionnaire repo: $git clone https://github.com/stat157/questionnaire.git ( in this step, you can't just copy and paste the Address, so I typted it) Third, change the directory to the questionnaire: $ cd questionnaire , list all the files and you can check it:$ls Now we have the file example.cfg in our VM, we copy it and change name to stat157 : $cp example.cfg ~/stat157.cfg Now we have file stat157.cfg in our homedirectory. Change the information in the stat157.cfg file $vi ~/stat157.cfg Fourth, run ipython notebook $ipython notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 open your browser, type: http://127.0.0.1:7777/ you should see the example.ipynb file, click it and under the "cell" click "run all"
